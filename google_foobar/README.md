# Google Foobar Coding Challenge
Google Foobar is a secret(ish) code challenge that Google is said to use as a hiring tool. It includes a series of five levels of algorithmic questions of ever-increasing difficulty and allotted time to solve these questions.
Foobar is entirely invintation only and if you do not commplete the challenges in the alloted time you are instantly kicked out of the challenge. 

- Level 1: One Question — 48 hours
- Level 2: Two Questions — 72 hours for each question
- Level 3: Three Questions — 7 days for each question
- Level 4: Two Questions — 2 weeks for each question
- Level 5: One Question — 22 days

### Whats here?
5 levels with 9 progressively harder questions:

- [01-01: Re IDs](/01_01_Re_ID)
- [02-01: Bunny Prisoner Locating](/02_01_Bunny_Prisoner_Locating)
- [02-02: Gearing Up for Destruction](/02_02_Gearing_Up_for_Destruction)
- [03-01: Queue To Do](/03_01_Queue_To_Do)
- [03-02: Fuel Injection Perfection](/03_02_Fuel_Injection_Perfection)
- [03-03: Doomsday Fuel](/03_03_Doomsday_Fuel)
- [04-01: Bringing a Gun to a Trainer Fight](/04_01_Bringing_a_Gun_to_a_Trainer_Fight)
- [04-02: Escape Pods](/04_02_Escape_Pods)
- [05-01: Expanding Nebula](/05_01_Expanding_Nebula)


***I will soon be adding details of the solutions and logic behind them***
