# Coding Challenges
This repo is set up to track some of the coding challenges I have participated in. More coming soon.

### Google Foobar Coding Challenge
I completed all 5 levels which included 9 progressively harder questions. All of the questions and solutions are in the [Google Foobar](https://github.com/sequenzia/challenges/tree/master/google_foobar) folder.
